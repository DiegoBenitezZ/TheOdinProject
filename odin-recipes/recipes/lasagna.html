                <li>2 bay leaves​</li>

                <li>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a lidded heavy-bottomed pan such as a cast iron pot. Season the brisket with salt and black pepper and brown over a high heat on all sides. Lift the meat out of the pan and set aside on a plate.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, carrot and celery. Cook for 4-5 mins until beginning to soften. Add the garlic, dried oregano, fresh thyme and bay leaves, then pour in the stock or wine. Stir well, scraping the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the tinned tomatoes, stir and return the beef joint to the pan. The liquid should almost cover the beef. Bring to a low simmer, cover and cook on the hob for 3-4 hrs, turning the beef every hour, until falling apart when pressed.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the cheese sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the flour. Cook for 2-3 mins until golden, then slowly add the milk, stirring, until you have a smooth sauce. Season with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Bring to a simmer and cook until beginning to thicken. Reduce the heat and add the grated cheddar and about half the parmesan. Cook until the cheese has melted, then remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>When the beef is cooked, carefully lift it out of the sauce on to a board, remove the string, halve across the grain of the meat and shred using 2 forks. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves from the ragu, return the beef to the pan and stir well.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Spread a little of the ragu over the base of a deep 26cm x 32cm baking dish. Lay 2-3 sheets of lasagne on top, then top with about half of the ragu and a thin layer of cheese sauce. Repeat with more pasta, ragu and sauce.</li>
                <li>Finish with the final 2-3 sheets of pasta and the rest of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle over the rest of the parmesan and scatter with thyme leaves. Bake for 40 mins, or until bubbling and golden brown. Leave to rest for 10 mins to firm up before serving.</li>
            </ol>
