                    <h2>Description</h2>
            
                    <summary>
                        Arepas are cornmeal cakes that originated hundreds of years ago in a region that now makes up Colombia, Venezuela, 
                        and Panama. Traditionally, they were cooked on a pan called a budare. But they can also be grilled, baked, or fried.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups precooked corn meal (see Notes below)</li>
                <li>2 1⁄2 cups water, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil, for the budare, griddle or non-stick pan</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>If the corners crack easily or the dough feels too dry, moisten with a little additional water.</li>
                <li>Tender, moist arepas can be made by adding a little oil to the dough.</li>
                <li>By shaping a bit of the dough to verify its consistency before adding extra water, you can avoid dense and gummy arepas.</li>
                <li>You’ll need a nonstick griddle or skillet for this recipe. If you do not have one, you can use a cast-iron skillet and lightly grease it before cooking each arepa.</li>
                <li>Use a knife to cut arepas down the center but leave the back ends attached and stuff your favorite stuffing.</li>
                <li>Before stuffing an arepa, it’s common to smear butter inside. It’s completely optional, but it’s highly suggested.</li>
                <li>To store arepas, keep them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3-5 days, for 3 months in the freezer.</li>
                <li>To reheat, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush arepas with water, wrap arepas with parchment paper and/or foil, and place in the oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
